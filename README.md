# Ensemble-Model-to-predict-Power-Outage (2nd place winner at Innovate Malaysia 2020)
This was a Design Challenge by Innovate Malaysia Competition 2020, the problem was to build a machine learning model which would detect anomaly and predict if a power outage occurrence would happen or not. The project is primarily built on Python and later cross-checked on SAS. To create the ensemble  Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Linear Regression was used. Due to the lack of proper interval-ed dataset Time-Series Analysis was kept on hold. Hoping to do that in future iterations.
